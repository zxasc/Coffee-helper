# Coffee Helper
Coffee helper is a simple website with written with vanilla CSS and JS that has a calculator and a stopwatch designed for mobile use.
I've written this website as a first, simple project that uses JS's document object.

## Sections and their functions
There are three main sections of the website.
The first one, labeled "Coffee-to-water ratio" calculates the amount of coffee you need for the given ratio and amount of water.
Second section, labeled "Ratio calculator" calculates the ratio of coffee to water from given water and coffee amounts. 
Third and final section is the stopwatch. It can be stopped and reset.
